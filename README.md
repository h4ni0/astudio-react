## Notes
I don't know if this is a trick question or not, but in the question I've been asked to include "filters" to the product page, and after looking at the document, it is pretty easy to notice that the products section doesn't have the ability to get a filtered requests from the server. I have included the mechanism for the filtering process assuming that the server support it but it's not working due to the reason I mentioned.
